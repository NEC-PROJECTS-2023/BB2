Introduction: To analyze the quality of red wine before its consumption to preserve human health. A
number of variables affects the quality of prediction. These considerations of different
factors contribute to the prediction of red wine quality. Using the machine learning
algorithms, this study provides a computational intelligence approach for predicting the red
wine quality. The proposed research approach uses Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes
Algorithm and Random Forest Classifier. We had used a red wine quality dataset for the
prediction purpose, and machine learning methods are used to predict the quality by models
comparing their accuracies.
